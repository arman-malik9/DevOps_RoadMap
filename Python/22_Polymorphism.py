# Function Polymorphism
# An example of a Python function that can be used on different objects is the len() function.
# String
# For strings len() returns the number of characters:

str = "Jahangirabad"
print(len(str))

list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(len(list))

mytuple = ("Cat","Dog","Fish")
print(len(mytuple))

mydict = {
    "Name" : "Arman",
    "Age" : 25,
    "City" : "Noida",
    "Qualification" : "B.Tech"
}
print(len(mydict))


# Class Polymorphism
# Polymorphism is often used in Class methods, where we can have multiple classes with the same method name.
# For example, say we have three classes: Car, Boat, and Plane, and they all have a method called move():

class Car:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Drive!")

class Boat:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang")       #Create a Car class
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat class
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747")     #Create a Plane class

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  x.move()


# Inheritance Class Polymorphism
# What about classes with child classes with the same name? Can we use polymorphism there?

# Yes. If we use the example above and make a parent class called Vehicle, and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle, the child classes inherits the Vehicle methods, but can override them:

# Example
# Create a class called Vehicle and make Car, Boat, Plane child classes of Vehicle:

class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, brand, model):
    self.brand = brand
    self.model = model

  def move(self):
    print("Move!")

class Car(Vehicle):
  pass

class Boat(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Sail!")

class Plane(Vehicle):
  def move(self):
    print("Fly!")

car1 = Car("Ford", "Mustang") #Create a Car object
boat1 = Boat("Ibiza", "Touring 20") #Create a Boat object
plane1 = Plane("Boeing", "747") #Create a Plane object

for x in (car1, boat1, plane1):
  print(x.brand)
  print(x.model)
  x.move()
